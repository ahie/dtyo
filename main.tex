% If you are working with a minimal LateX distribution, you may have to install some extra packages. Make sure that at least babel-finnish (available in e.g. texlive-lang-european) and the basic fonts (e.g. texlive-fonts-recommended) are installed.

\usepackage[fixlanguage]{babelbib} % You should use this unless you are using biblatex. Add option fixlanguage if you're writing in English (the thesis writing guide is asymmetric, requiring Finnish theses to have e.g. 'eds.' for sources in English, while requiring English theses to have all such parts in English)

\usepackage{textcase} % may be used to keep parts of title lowercase
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{tabularx} % e.g. multiline cells
%\usepackage{calc} %for performing length arithmetic such as column width = text width minus some other width
%\usepackage{longtable} % for tables spanning multiple pages
%\usepackage{psfrag} % editing ps files
%\usepackage{subfig} % parallel small figures a,b,c,...
%\usepackage{rotating} % for rotating e.g. full-page figures
%\usepackage{siunitx} % nice formatting for combinations of number and unit
\usepackage{amsopn} % For operator names; not necessary if amsmath is used
%\usepackage[fleqn]{amsmath} %Extensions to math handling; if you use this, you should use e.g. gather instead of equation due to a hyperref bug
\usepackage{listings} %Typesetting code
\usepackage{color}
\lstset{basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily, numbers=left}

\thesistype{Master’s thesis} % Do not use ASCII apostrophe ' as it will not be substituted with the correct one (’) in the PDF metadata. Note that there are both short version (this) and a long one - "Master’s" vs. "Master of Science"

% Packages that need to be loaded late
% ----------------------------------------------
%\usepackage[a-2u]{pdfx} % If you're using PDFLatex and your version of pdfx is not recent enough, you may run into the inputencoding bug. In that case, load inputenc after pdfx (and replace any non-ASCII characters in the metadata with e.g. \"{a})

\usepackage{hyperref} % This must (usually) be the last package you load - load this OR pdfx (which also loads hyperref). Usage of pdfx would be nice, but if you have issues with that you may fall back to just hyperref
