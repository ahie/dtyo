\section{Evaluation metrics}

The quantitative evaluation of unsupervised, non-linear dimensionality reduction methods is a challenging problem.

To evaluate the efficacy of the method proposed in this work we employ three different quantitative metrics.

Namely, the trustworthiness score, continuity and for labeled data sets 1-NN classification accuracy will be used.

\subsection{Trustworthiness}

\subsection{Continuity}

\subsection{1-NN classifier}

\section{Data sets}

\subsection{MNIST}

One of the most widely used data sets in current machine learning, being the most used 

\subsection{SVHN}

The Google \textit{Street View House Numbers} data set bares a great resemblance to MNIST yet being a considerably harder data set to learn.

Typically supervised feature extraction has been used to preprocess the original images into feature vectors, such as in ... where convolutional neural networks are applied to ...

In this work we directly use the cropped and uncropped street view house numbers set.

\subsection{Mass cytometry data}
