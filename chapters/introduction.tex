\label{ch:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item A major challenge in modern data analysis 
\item analysis of high dimensional data, examples
\item dimensionality reduction
\item curse of dimensionality
\item linear and non linear
\item problems with existing methods
\item neural networks provide way for scalable learning of complex functions
\item additionally enables parametric extension
\item in this thesis...
\item The structure of this thesis is as follows. Chapters /ref{ch:vae} and /ref{ch:tsne} cover the relevant background literature for the methods proposed in chapter /ref{ch:methods}, where chapter /ref{ch:vae} discusses the theory behind Variational Autoencoders and chapter /ref{ch:tsne} presents t-SNE, as well as its parametric extension. In chapter /ref{ch:results} several empirical results for the proposed method are presented, along with comparisons to other popular methods. The final chapters are reserved for discussion and conclusions.
